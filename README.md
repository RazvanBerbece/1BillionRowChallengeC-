# 1BillionRowChallengeCsharp
My attempt at 'The 1 Billion Row Challenge' in C#.

After seeing a couple of videos on YouTube of people attempting this in Go (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ1PDS7iRU8, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYng524S-MA&t=1607s),
I got curious and wanted to see how C# would perform in this challenge. Mind that I am not really into low level optimisations myself, so this will be kind of like a fun documented explorative exercise :).
