# 1BillionRowChallengeCsharp
My attempt at 'The 1 Billion Row Challenge' in C#.

After seeing a couple of videos on YouTube of people attempting this in Go (refs 1, 2),
I got curious and wanted to see how C# would perform in this challenge. Mind that I am not really into low level optimisations myself, so this will be kind of like a fun documented explorative exercise :).

For more details about the '1 Billion Row Challenge', see this very interesting blog article: https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/.
